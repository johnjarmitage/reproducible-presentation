# A Reproducible Presentation

This repository contains:

* A presentation I gave for Landscapes Live on the problem of resolution dependent landscape evolution models and making reproducible presentations/publications: `presentation.ipynb`. The idea is that the presentation is reprducible too. 

* A presentation on the same theme that I gave to the doctoral school at IFP energies nouvelles: `presentation-ifpschool.ipynb`

* Clone the repo, create the conda (or mamba) environment and open up the notebook.
* Build the docker image from the docker file, look at the last few lines of the log file, and navigate to the notebook.
